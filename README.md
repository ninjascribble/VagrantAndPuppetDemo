Vagrant & Puppet
==
This is a simple demo I put together for a buddy to showcase how simple building out a server environment can be with Vagrant and Puppet.

Getting Started
--
Make sure you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed; Vagrant will take care of the rest!

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ninjascribble/VagrantAndPuppetDemo.git /path/to/projectdir
$ cd /path/to/projectdir
$ vagrant up
```

#### PHPMyAdmin
In the dev environment you can access PHPMyAdmin from [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). By default the username is **root** and the password is **admin**.
